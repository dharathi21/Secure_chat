 Secure Chat App with End-to-End Encryption

  This project is a real-time, browser-based chat application that ensures private and secure communication  using  End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). Messages are encrypted on the senderâ€™s device and decrypted only on the recipientâ€™s device. The server simply acts as a relay and cannot read any of the message content.

 Features:
â€¢	RSA Key Pair generation on the client-side
â€¢	 Public key exchange using Flask-SocketIO
â€¢	AES encryption for message confidentiality
â€¢	 Real-time messaging powered by Flask-SocketIO
â€¢	 Server has no access to message contents (true E2EE)
â€¢	 Simple, clean UI built with HTML and JavaScript

How End-to-End Encryption Works:

o	Every user generates their own RSA key pair (public + private).
o	When a user joins a room, their public key is shared with others.
o	For each message:
             An AES symmetric key is generated.
o	The message is encrypted with AES.
o	The AES key is encrypted using the receiver's RSA public key.
o	The server forwards the encrypted AES key and message.
o	The recipient:
                    Uses their private key to decrypt the AES key.
                    Uses that AES key to decrypt the message.

o	 Only the recipient can read the message.
o	 Server cannot decrypt or view any message content.
